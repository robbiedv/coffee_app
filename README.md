## Coffee Recipe App

I had fun creating this project, but there are many things I would change during a refactor\
A few of these things would be,
- implement stores to handle data
- refactor into smaller components for better maintainability
- ui support for mobile devices
- ui library for improved appearance and faster development times
- auth for users to login
- database for users to save recipes to
